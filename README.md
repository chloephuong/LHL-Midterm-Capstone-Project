# LHL-Midterm-Capstone-Project

## Project/Goals

The objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis and create meaningful visualizations using crime data from Los Angeles. The project involved two main stages: data preprocessing and analysis using Python, and visualization using Tableau. The ultimate goal was to gain insights and communicate findings regarding crime patterns, victim demographics, and other relevant aspects of the dataset.

## Process

#### Step 1: Data Collection:
The first step of the project involved obtaining the raw crime dataset for Los Angeles. The dataset included attributes such as crime code description, date of occurrence, time of occurrence, location, area name, premise description, status of the report, victim descent, victim sex, weapon description, crime code count, latitude, longitude, and victim age.

#### Step 2: Data Preprocessing:
To ensure data integrity and reliability, the raw dataset underwent preprocessing using Python. This step included handling missing values, transforming data types, and extracting relevant features. Additionally, data cleaning techniques were applied to address any inconsistencies or anomalies in the dataset.

#### Step 3: Regression Modeling:
To investigate the relationship between variables and make predictions, a regression model was built. The model focused on examining the impact of victim age on the type of crime experienced. The linear regression model was implemented using Python's statsmodels library, and model evaluation metrics were analyzed to assess the model's performance.

#### Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
After preprocessing the data, an exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset. This involved performing descriptive statistics, visualizing data distributions, and identifying patterns and trends within the crime data. EDA techniques such as histogram, scatter plot, and bar chart were utilized to explore relationships between variables and identify potential insights.

#### Step 5: Tableau Visualization:
To effectively communicate the findings and provide an interactive visual experience, Tableau was used for data visualization. Various types of visualizations were created, including maps, pie charts, bar charts, and scatter plots. These visualizations highlighted crime hotspots, crime type distribution, victim demographics, time of occurrence, and status of reported crimes.

#### Step 6: Storytelling and Dashboard Creation:
To present the findings in a cohesive and engaging manner, a story and interactive dashboards were created in Tableau. The story provided a narrative flow to guide the audience through the project's insights, while dashboards allowed for further exploration and analysis of the crime data. Interactive features such as filters, tooltips, and drill-down capabilities were incorporated to enhance user interaction and understanding.

## Results
Through the systematic process of data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, regression modeling, and visualization using Python and Tableau, this project successfully uncovered valuable insights into crime patterns and victim demographics in Los Angeles. The findings can contribute to informed decision-making in crime prevention and law enforcement efforts. The combination of analytical techniques and interactive visualizations provides a comprehensive understanding of the crime data and supports effective communication of the results.


## Challenges 
Throughout the project, we faced several challenges that required careful problem-solving and adaptability. Some of the main challenges we encountered are as follows:

- Missing Values: The dataset contained missing values in various attributes, which posed a challenge in data analysis and modeling. We had to decide on appropriate strategies to handle these missing values, such as imputation or exclusion, while ensuring the integrity of the data.

- Building Regression Model: The process of building a regression model to examine the relationship between victim age and crime type presented some difficulties. We had to carefully select the appropriate variables and address issues such as multicollinearity and model performance evaluation. Iterative refinement of the model was necessary to achieve meaningful insights.

- Choosing Suitable EDA Techniques: The dataset comprised diverse attributes, making it challenging to determine the most suitable exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. We had to explore different visualization methods and statistical measures to effectively analyze the relationships and patterns in the data.

- Technical Issues with Version Control: We encountered technical issues while using version control tools like GitHub. Pushing and pulling large files, especially the datasets and visualization outputs, sometimes led to conflicts and increased the complexity of collaboration. We had to carefully manage the version control process to ensure smooth collaboration among team members.

- File Size Limitations: The size of the dataset and visualization outputs posed challenges when uploading and sharing the files. The large file sizes made it difficult to push the files to GitHub or share them through certain communication platforms. We had to explore alternative methods, such as compressing files or utilizing cloud storage solutions, to overcome this limitation.

## Future Goals
If we had more time and resources, we would like to spend it on exploring how to build Machine learning models and Predictive modeling for this project.
